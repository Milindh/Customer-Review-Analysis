# Customer-Review-Analysis

The data consists of Customer review and comments about medicines and gummies to help people have better sleep. 
In this model we are using this data and fetching the comments to analyse which medicine has the best reviews amoung its customers

We are using NLTK to train the model on the textual data that is the comments given by the customers. 
Before using NLTK we are splitting thr comments into keywords the algorithm should search for and stop words that should be removed from the comments

The repository consists of the data and the Jupyter Files.
